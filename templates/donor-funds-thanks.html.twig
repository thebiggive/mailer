        Dear {{ donorFirstName }},
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for transferring {{ transferAmount }} into your Big Give account. The bank transfer was successful and
        {{ newBalance }} is now available for you to donate to your chosen charities in our campaign. Please note that
        your funds will not count as a donation until you have completed the following steps:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Select a charity</li>

        <li>Click the 'Donate now' button on the charity's campaign page</li>

        <li>Click on 'Log in' to access your account, using the email and password you set when you first created it.
        </li>

        <li>Choose the amount you'd like to donate to the charity. The donation payment will be taken from your
            available balance.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Any unspent funds will remain in your account for 90 days. If they are not used in this time, any remaining
        balance will be automatically refunded to you.
    </p>
